Good afternoon, I'm Fco. Figueroa, and welcome to my Final Project presentation.
I'd like to preface my presentation with a bit of context that the direct purpose
of this grouping of data was not for the consumer of soccer as a sport but for someone
that was not yet familiar with advanced stats but had the basic understanding of the 
game down. 

That being said lets get started. For all three of my visualizations I choose to
represent some of the different levels of competition found through soccer those being:
individual club level, domestic league level, and international team level. My goal is
to provide context on the impact that defensive competition can have from the lower
club level and how we can see it reverberate towards the top of the competition schema.

-- Figure 2 --
Here we'll start from the bottom up at the team level. Here we can see that I've
marked the clubs by their domestic leagues and while here on a club level we see that
from the top 10 best ranked clubs in Europe for last season Chelsea found success on a 
club level continentally, the amount of clubs within the top 10 that entered from Italy
will  come into play later.

-- Figure 1 --
We see here on the next figure, I've divided the entirety of the top 5 leagues in 
Europe up and the reg. line gives us the fairly obviously correlation between the 
amount of tackles attempted and the # of interceptions that you would hope to see as
the tackles increase. Here we start seeing other relationships though such as how even
though some English league clubs tend to have some very def. efficient teams,
they also take the most and are somewhat top-heavy with a lot of clubs petering out 
towards the less desired positions on the scattergram, same with the German league.
Now if we take a look at the Italian league preformance we can see that most of them
are better than the correlation proposed by the reg. line and that they seemed to be 
the most effective at defensive play backing their number of teams entering the top 10
in the last figure. 

-- Figure 3 --
Finally, we get to the international level of play where we see that the defensive
capabilities of each nation's domestic league translated pretty well into tournament
placement. Italy drew once in the group stage but never lost during the entire comp.
England although having the same amount of wins actually fell to Italy in the tournament
to be placed as runner-ups. Both German French teams were knocked out early in the
play off stages after poor tournaments while Spain had actually become a dark horse
getting by draws and penalty shoot-outs but also ultimately falling to Italy.
And Here we can see how defensive efficacy can shoot up through
the different tiers of the sport in a fashion that I hope was easy to follow. Thank you.
