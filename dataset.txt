I choose these sets of data because I was curious whether there were large differences or 
patterns in the amount of tackles being performed versus the amount of actual interceptions
being achieved in the top 5 European soccer leagues. This I had even thought would fit a 
scatter plot model in case the trend by team followed a specific direction the more elite
defense was supposedly played in said league. I wanted to focus on defensive actions because
typically, sports analysts tend to undervalue riskier defensive actions and forego that a
attacking has more importance. A visualization of defensive actions between winners of these
leagues was also something I wanted to create to get a better idea of the strength of squad
defense also translated to internation play at the club level.
